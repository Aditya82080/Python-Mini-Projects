# Unit Converter
## Description
The Unit Converter is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the `tkinter` library. It allows users to easily convert units in four categories:

- Length
- Mass
- Temperature
- Volume
Users can input a value, select the units they wish to convert from and to, and instantly get the conversion result.

## Features
- Graphical Interface: Intuitive and user-friendly GUI for seamless interaction.
- Four Conversion Categories:
     - Length: Convert between meters, kilometers, miles, inches, and more.
     - Mass: Convert between kilograms, grams, pounds, and more.
     - Temperature: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
     - Volume: Convert between liters, gallons, cups, and more.
- Dynamic Unit Selection: Automatically updates available units based on the selected category.
- Error Handling: Alerts users for invalid inputs or unit combinations.

## Required Modules
- tkinter: For creating the GUI.
- ttk: A part of `tkinter` for modern styled widgets.
- messagebox: From `tkinter`, used for error pop-ups.

These modules are part of Pythonâ€™s standard library, so no external installation is required.

## How to Install Required Modules
Since all required modules are part of Python's standard library, ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above).

To check if Python is installed:
```bash
python --version
```
or

```bash
python3 --version
```
If Python is not installed, download and install it from python.org.
